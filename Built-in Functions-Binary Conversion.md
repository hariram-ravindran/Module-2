# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16
b=bin(a)
print(b)
```

## Output
![440387383-f4d3c1a4-4679-492d-a486-aa715c8ceacd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ddda52-9783-4de6-9960-0f2474374dd2)

## Result
Thus the program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is executed successfully.
